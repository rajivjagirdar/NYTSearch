# NYTSearch

Phase 1: 
## Back-End Team

* Do preliminary research on the [API](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json).

* Register for an API Key.

* Understand what format the URL should look like to make an Article Call. (Hint: Use the API Console!!)

* Experiment with console logging various fields.

Phase 2: 
## Back-End Team

* Create the AJAX call needed to retrieve data then console.log all of the relevant fields.

* Incorporate various “optional parameters” (hard code these in initially).

* Take note of various “bugs” that appear with certain searches.

Phase 3: 
## Back-End Team

* Put in a hard-effort to deal with bugs. How can you handle missing fields?
